Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \\\\\\\\boxed{}.\\\\n\\\\nSketch the graph of the function $g(x) = \\\\\\\\ln(x^5 + 5) - x^3$.'}<think>\\nOkay, so I need to sketch the graph of the function g(x) = ln(x⁵ + 5) - x³. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that sketching functions usually involves finding key points like intercepts, asymptotes, critical points for increasing/decreasing behavior, inflection points for concavity, and maybe some symmetry. Let me start by breaking down the function.\\n\\nFirst, the function is a combination of a logarithmic function and a polynomial. The natural log term is ln(x⁵ + 5), and then subtracting x³. Let me consider the domain first. Since ln(x⁵ + 5) is part of the function, the argument of the logarithm must be positive. So x⁵ + 5 > 0. Let's solve that:\\n\\nx⁵ + 5 > 0\\nx⁵ > -5\\nx > (-5)^(1/5)\\n\\nCalculating (-5)^(1/5)... since the fifth root of a negative number is negative. Let me compute that. The fifth root of 32 is 2, so the fifth root of -32 is -2. But here it's -5. So (-5)^(1/5) is approximately -5^(1/5). Since 5^(1/5) is around 1.38 (since 1.38^5 ≈ 5), so the fifth root of -5 is approximately -1.38. Therefore, the domain is all real numbers x where x > -5^(1/5), which is roughly x > -1.38. Wait, but x⁵ is a continuous function, and for x values less than that, x⁵ +5 would be negative, which is not allowed. So the domain is x > -5^(1/5). Hmm, but maybe I should check if there's a real fifth root here. Since it's an odd root, yes, any real number has a real fifth root. So, the domain is all real numbers x such that x > - (5)^(1/5). So approximately, x > -1.38. So that's the domain. Important to note for sketching the graph; the function is only defined for x greater than that value.\\n\\nNext, maybe find intercepts. Let's look for the y-intercept when x = 0. Plugging in x = 0:\\n\\ng(0) = ln(0⁵ + 5) - 0³ = ln(5) - 0 ≈ 1.609. So the y-intercept is at (0, ln5).\\n\\nFor the x-intercept, set g(x) = 0:\\n\\nln(x⁵ +5) - x³ = 0\\nln(x⁵ +5) = x³\\n\\nThis equation is probably not solvable algebraically. So we might need to estimate or use numerical methods. Let me see if I can find some integer values where this might hold. Let's test x = 1:\\n\\nln(1 +5) = ln(6) ≈ 1.7918, and x³ = 1. So 1.7918 ≈ 1. Not equal. x=2:\\n\\nln(32 +5)=ln(37)≈3.6109, and x³=8. So 3.61 ≈8? Not close. x= -1:\\n\\nWait, x must be > -1.38. Let's try x=-1. Then x⁵ +5 = (-1)^5 +5= -1 +5=4. ln(4)≈1.386, and x³=(-1)^3=-1. So equation becomes 1.386 = -1? No. Not possible. How about x=0.5: x³=0.125, ln((0.5)^5 +5)=ln(0.03125 +5)=ln(5.03125)≈1.616. So 1.616 vs 0.125. Not equal. Hmm. Maybe between x=1 and x=2. Wait, at x=1, left side is ln(6)≈1.7918, right side is 1. So left > right. At x=2, left is ln(37)≈3.6109, right is 8. So left < right. Since ln(x⁵ +5) increases but x³ increases faster? Wait, but maybe there's a crossing point between 1 and 2. Let's try x=1.5: x³=3.375. Then ln((1.5)^5 +5). Compute (1.5)^5: 1.5^2=2.25, 1.5^3=3.375, 1.5^4=5.0625, 1.5^5=7.59375. So ln(7.59375 +5)=ln(12.59375)≈2.533. Compared to x³=3.375. So 2.533 <3.375. So equation ln(...) =x³ is not true here. So left side is less. So between x=1 and x=1.5, the left side goes from 1.79 to 2.53, right side goes from 1 to 3.375. So they might cross somewhere. Wait, when x=1.2: x³=1.728. (1.2)^5: 1.2^2=1.44, 1.2^3=1.728, 1.2^4=2.0736, 1.2^5=2.48832. So ln(2.48832 +5)=ln(7.48832)=2.013. So 2.013 vs 1.728. So left > right. So between 1.2 and 1.5, the left side goes from 2.013 to 2.533, the right side goes from 1.728 to3.375. So they must cross where the left side is equal to the right side. Maybe around x=1.3? Let's try x=1.3: x³=2.197. (1.3)^5: 1.3^2=1.69, 1.3^3=2.197, 1.3^4=2.8561, 1.3^5=3.71293. So ln(3.71293 +5)=ln(8.71293)=2.165. Compare to x³=2.197. So left=2.165, right=2.197. Close. So left is less than right. So between 1.2 and 1.3. At x=1.25: x³=1.953. (1.25)^5: 1.25^2=1.5625, 1.25^3=1.953125, 1.25^4=2.44140625, 1.25^5≈3.0517578125. So ln(3.0517578125 +5)=ln(8.0517578125)=2.086. x³=1.953. So left=2.086 >1.953. So cross between x=1.25 and 1.3. Let's try x=1.275: x³=1.275^3≈1.275*1.275=1.6256; 1.6256*1.275≈2.073. (1.275)^5: Let's compute that. (1.275)^2=1.6256. Then (1.6256)*(1.275)=2.073 (as above). Then (2.073)*(1.275)=2.644. Then (2.644)*(1.275)=3.373. So (1.275)^5≈3.373. So ln(3.373 +5)=ln(8.373)=2.126. x³≈(1.275)^3≈2.073. So left=2.126 vs right=2.073. So left > right. So crossing between x=1.275 and x=1.3. Maybe at x=1.28: x³≈1.28^3=1.28*1.28=1.6384, 1.6384*1.28≈2.097. (1.28)^5: (1.28)^2=1.6384, (1.28)^3=2.097, (1.28)^4≈2.097*1.28≈2.684, (1.28)^5≈2.684*1.28≈3.436. So ln(3.436 +5)=ln(8.436)≈2.133. x³≈2.097. So 2.133 >2.097. Still left > right. x=1.29: x³≈1.29^3≈2.146. (1.29)^5: first (1.29)^2=1.6641, then ^3=1.6641*1.29≈2.146, ^4=2.146*1.29≈2.77, ^5≈2.77*1.29≈3.573. ln(3.573+5)=ln(8.573)≈2.149. x³≈2.146. So left≈2.149 vs right≈2.146. Close. So approximately at x≈1.29, they cross. So x≈1.29 is an x-intercept. Hmm. So the function crosses the x-axis around x≈1.29. Similarly, maybe there's another intercept at some negative x? Wait, domain starts at x≈-1.38. Let's check x=-1: we have x³= -1, ln(x⁵ +5)=ln(4)≈1.386. So 1.386 - (-1)=2.386. So positive. At x approaching -1.38 from the right: x approaches -5^(1/5)≈-1.38. Then x⁵ +5 approaches 0, so ln(x⁵ +5) approaches -infinity. However, x³ approaches (-1.38)^3≈-2.628. So ln(approaching 0) is approaching negative infinity, and -x³ would be +2.628. But the dominant term is ln approaching -infinity, so overall g(x) approaches -infinity as x approaches -1.38 from the right. Therefore, near the left end of the domain, the function goes to -infinity. At x=-1.38, vertical asymptote?\\n\\nWait, actually, when x approaches -5^(1/5) from the right, x⁵ +5 approaches 0 from the positive side, so ln(x⁵ +5) approaches -infinity. Therefore, g(x) = ln(...) -x³ tends to -infinity minus a finite number (since x³ is approaching (-5^(1/5))^3 which is finite). Therefore, the limit as x approaches -5^(1/5)+ is -infinity. So there's a vertical asymptote at x = -5^(1/5).\\n\\nSo the function starts from the bottom (negative infinity) near x≈-1.38, comes up, has a y-intercept at (0, ln5≈1.609), then crosses the x-axis around x≈1.29. Then what happens as x increases beyond that? Let's check the behavior as x approaches infinity. As x→infty, ln(x⁵ +5) behaves like ln(x⁵) = 5 ln x, and x³. So g(x) ≈5 ln x -x³. As x becomes large, the -x³ term will dominate, so g(x) tends to -infinity. So the right end goes to -infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, the function starts at the left (near x≈-1.38) going to -infty, comes up, crosses the y-axis at around 1.6, then crosses the x-axis around x≈1.29, then as x increases further, it tends to -infinity. So the graph might have a peak somewhere. Let's find critical points by taking the derivative.\\n\\nCompute g'(x). The derivative of ln(x⁵ +5) is (5x⁴)/(x⁵ +5). The derivative of -x³ is -3x². So:\\n\\ng'(x) = (5x⁴)/(x⁵ +5) - 3x².\\n\\nSet this equal to zero to find critical points:\\n\\n(5x⁴)/(x⁵ +5) - 3x² =0\\n\\nMultiply both sides by (x⁵ +5):\\n\\n5x⁴ - 3x²(x⁵ +5) =0\\n\\n5x⁴ -3x⁷ -15x²=0\\n\\nLet's factor:\\n\\nx²(5x² -3x⁵ -15)=0\\n\\nSo critical points at x=0, and solutions to 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0.\\n\\nFirst, x=0 is a critical point. Let's check if that's a maximum or minimum. Let me compute the second derivative later. For now, let's see the other critical points.\\n\\nWe need to solve 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0.\\n\\nLet me rearrange:\\n\\n-3x⁵ +5x² -15=0\\n\\nMultiply both sides by -1:\\n\\n3x⁵ -5x² +15=0\\n\\nHmm, this is a quintic equation, which probably doesn't have an algebraic solution. So maybe we can find real roots numerically. Let's check possible real roots.\\n\\nLet me try x=1: 3 -5 +15=13 ≠0.\\n\\nx=2: 3*32 -5*4 +15=96 -20 +15=91≠0.\\n\\nx= -1: 3*(-1)^5 -5*(-1)^2 +15= -3 -5 +15=7≠0.\\n\\nx=0: 0 -0 +15=15≠0.\\n\\nSo maybe there are no rational roots. Let's see the behavior of the function f(x)=3x⁵ -5x² +15.\\n\\nAs x→infty, the 3x⁵ term dominates, so f(x)→infty. As x→-infty, since it's an odd degree, 3x⁵ term dominates, so f(x)→-infty. So there must be at least one real root. Let's check between x= -2 and x=-1.\\n\\nAt x= -2: 3*(-32) -5*4 +15= -96 -20 +15= -101.\\n\\nAt x= -1: f(-1)= -3 -5 +15=7. So between x=-2 and x=-1, f(x) goes from -101 to7, so crosses zero. So there's a root between x=-2 and x=-1. However, our domain is x > -1.38≈-5^(1/5)≈-1.38. So x between -2 and -1.38 is allowed. Wait, because x must be greater than -1.38. So in the domain x > -1.38, let's check if 3x⁵ -5x² +15=0 has a root.\\n\\nWait, x= -1.38: let's compute f(-1.38). Compute x= -1.38:\\n\\nx⁵≈(-1.38)^5. Let me compute that:\\n\\n(-1.38)^2≈1.9044. Then (-1.38)^3≈-2.628. Then (-1.38)^4≈3.62, then (-1.38)^5≈-4.99. So 3*(-4.99)≈-14.97, -5*(1.9044)≈-9.522, so total f(-1.38)= -14.97 -9.522 +15≈-14.97 -9.522= -24.492 +15≈-9.492. So f(-1.38)≈-9.492.\\n\\nThen, when x increases from -1.38 to 0, since f(x)=3x⁵ -5x² +15. At x=0, f(0)=0 -0 +15=15. So between x=-1.38 and x=0, f(x) goes from -9.492 to 15, so must cross zero once. Therefore, in the domain x > -1.38, there is a real root of 3x⁵ -5x² +15=0 between x=-1.38 and x=0. Hence, the equation 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0 has a root in that interval, so there's another critical point there. Let's approximate it.\\n\\nLet me try x=-1: f(x)=3*(-1)^5 -5*(-1)^2 +15= -3 -5 +15=7. At x=-1.38, f(x)≈-9.492. So between x=-1.38 and x=-1, f(x) goes from -9.492 to7. Let's use the Intermediate Value Theorem. Let's try x=-1.2: x=-1.2, compute f(-1.2)=3*(-1.2)^5 -5*(-1.2)^2 +15.\\n\\nCompute (-1.2)^2=1.44, (-1.2)^5=(-1.2)^2*(-1.2)^3=1.44*(-1.728)= -2.48832. So 3*(-2.48832)= -7.46496. -5*(1.44)= -7.2. So total f(-1.2)= -7.46496 -7.2 +15≈-14.66496 +15≈0.335. So f(-1.2)≈0.335. Close to zero. Let's check x=-1.21:\\n\\nx=-1.21. Compute (-1.21)^2=1.4641. (-1.21)^3= -1.21*1.4641≈-1.771561. Then (-1.21)^5= (-1.21)^3 * (-1.21)^2≈ (-1.771561)*(1.4641)≈-2.593. So 3*(-2.593)= -7.779. -5*(1.4641)= -7.3205. So f(-1.21)= -7.779 -7.3205 +15≈-15.0995 +15≈-0.0995. So f(-1.21)≈-0.0995. Therefore, the root is between x=-1.21 and x=-1.2. Let's use linear approximation. Between x=-1.21 (f≈-0.0995) and x=-1.2 (f≈0.335). The difference in x is 0.01, the difference in f is 0.335 - (-0.0995)=0.4345. To find the x where f=0: starting from x=-1.21, need to go up by 0.0995. So delta_x≈0.01*(0.0995/0.4345)≈0.01*0.229≈0.00229. So approximate root at x≈-1.21 +0.00229≈-1.2077. So around x≈-1.208.\\n\\nTherefore, the critical points are at x≈-1.208, x=0, and potentially others from the quintic. But we saw that 3x⁵ -5x² +15=0 has a real root in the domain. Wait, we found one root between x=-1.38 and x=0. Are there more? Let's check for x>0.\\n\\nAt x=1: f(1)=3*1 -5*1 +15=13. At x=2: f(2)=3*32 -5*4 +15=96 -20 +15=91. So f(x) is positive there. As x approaches infinity, f(x)=3x⁵ -5x² +15≈3x⁵→infty. So no roots there. For x>0, f(x) is always positive. Therefore, only one real root in x > -1.38, which is approximately x≈-1.208.\\n\\nTherefore, critical points are at x≈-1.208, x=0, and perhaps others? Wait, when we factored the derivative, we had x²(5x² -3x⁵ -15)=0. So x=0 is a double root? Wait, x=0 is a root from x²=0. Then the other roots come from 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0. So we already considered that. So in total, critical points at x≈-1.208, x=0. Wait, but 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0 has one real root in the domain, so that gives two critical points: x≈-1.208 and x=0? Wait, no. The equation was x²*(5x² -3x⁵ -15)=0. So x=0 (with multiplicity 2 from x²) and the roots of 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0. Wait, no, original equation after multiplying out was 5x⁴ -3x⁷ -15x²=0, which factors to x²(5x² -3x⁵ -15)=0. So x²=0 (so x=0 double root) and 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0, which has roots. We found that equation has one real root in the domain at x≈-1.208. So the critical points are x≈-1.208 and x=0.\\n\\nTherefore, we have critical points at x≈-1.208 and x=0. Let's analyze these.\\n\\nFirst, x≈-1.208. Let's check the derivative around that point. For x just less than -1.208 (but still in the domain), and just more. Wait, but x must be greater than -1.38. Let's take x=-1.3 (which is just greater than -1.38?), no, wait, -1.3 is greater than -1.38. Wait, x=-1.208 is approximately where? Between -1.38 and 0. Wait, actually, since -1.208 is greater than -1.38 (since -1.208 is -1.2 which is greater than -1.38). So, critical point at x≈-1.208. Let's check the sign of g'(x) around x=-1.208.\\n\\nTake x=-1.21 (left side) and x=-1.20 (right side). Wait, but x=-1.21 is less than -1.208? Wait, x=-1.208 is approximately -1.21. Let me be precise. Let's pick x=-1.21 and x=-1.20. Wait, x=-1.21 is actually less than -1.208? Since -1.208 is approximately -1.21 when rounded to two decimal places. Maybe not. Let me just compute the derivative at x=-1.21 and x=-1.20.\\n\\nAt x=-1.21:\\n\\ng'(x) = (5x⁴)/(x⁵ +5) -3x²\\n\\nCompute x⁵: (-1.21)^5≈-2.593 (as before). x⁵ +5≈2.407. Then 5x⁴=5*( (-1.21)^4 ). (-1.21)^2=1.4641, so (-1.21)^4≈(1.4641)^2≈2.143. So 5*2.143≈10.715. Then 10.715 /2.407≈4.45. Then -3x²= -3*(1.4641)≈-4.392. So g'(x)=4.45 -4.392≈0.058. Positive.\\n\\nAt x=-1.20: x=-1.20\\n\\nx⁵=(-1.2)^5≈-2.48832. x⁵ +5≈2.51168. 5x⁴=5*(1.2)^4. (1.2)^2=1.44, (1.2)^4=2.0736. 5*2.0736≈10.368. 10.368 /2.51168≈4.128. -3x²= -3*(1.44)= -4.32. So g'(x)=4.128 -4.32≈-0.192. Negative.\\n\\nTherefore, as x increases through -1.208, the derivative goes from positive to negative. Therefore, x≈-1.208 is a local maximum.\\n\\nAt x=0: the critical point. Let's check the derivative around x=0.\\n\\nFor x near 0, say x=0.1 and x=-0.1 (but x must be > -1.38, so -0.1 is allowed).\\n\\nAt x=0.1:\\n\\ng'(0.1) = (5*(0.1)^4)/( (0.1)^5 +5 ) -3*(0.1)^2 ≈ (5*0.0001)/(0.00001 +5) -0.03 ≈ 0.0005/5.00001 -0.03 ≈0.0001 -0.03≈-0.0299. Negative.\\n\\nAt x=-0.1:\\n\\nx=-0.1. Compute x⁵ +5= (-0.1)^5 +5≈-0.00001 +5≈4.99999. 5x⁴=5*(0.1)^4=5*0.0001=0.0005. So (0.0005)/4.99999≈0.0001. -3x²= -3*(0.01)= -0.03. So g'(-0.1)=0.0001 -0.03≈-0.0299. Negative.\\n\\nWait, so the derivative is negative on both sides of x=0. Therefore, x=0 is not a local maximum or minimum; it's a saddle point? Wait, but since the derivative doesn't change sign (remains negative), then x=0 is not an extremum. So even though x=0 is a critical point (since derivative is zero there), the function is decreasing before and after, so it's a horizontal point of inflection? Or maybe a saddle point. Hmm. Let's confirm with second derivative.\\n\\nCompute the second derivative g''(x). First, g'(x)= (5x⁴)/(x⁵ +5) -3x².\\n\\nDifferentiate this:\\n\\nFirst term: d/dx [5x⁴/(x⁵ +5)]. Use quotient rule: [ (20x³)(x⁵ +5) -5x⁴*(5x⁴) ] / (x⁵ +5)^2.\\n\\nNumerator: 20x³(x⁵ +5) -25x^8 =20x³* x⁵ +20x³*5 -25x^8=20x^8 +100x³ -25x^8= -5x^8 +100x³.\\n\\nSo first term's derivative: (-5x^8 +100x³)/(x⁵ +5)^2.\\n\\nSecond term: derivative of -3x² is -6x.\\n\\nSo g''(x) = [(-5x^8 +100x³)/(x⁵ +5)^2] -6x.\\n\\nEvaluate at x=0:\\n\\nNumerator of first term at x=0: -5*0 +100*0=0. Denominator: (0 +5)^2=25. So first term:0/25=0. Second term: -6*0=0. So g''(0)=0. Inconclusive. Hmm. So second derivative is zero, so the test is inconclusive.\\n\\nSo at x=0, the concavity might change, but since the first derivative doesn't change sign, it's a saddle point. So even though x=0 is a critical point, there's no local max or min there. So perhaps the function is decreasing through x=0.\\n\\nSo overall, the critical points are x≈-1.208 (local maximum) and x=0 (no extremum). Then, any other critical points? Wait, when I solved 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0, I found one real root in the domain, but the equation is 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0, which we found has a root at x≈-1.208. Are there more roots? For x>0, as x increases, 5x² -3x⁵ -15=0. Let me check x=2:5*4 -3*32 -15=20 -96 -15=-91. At x=3:5*9 -3*243 -15=45 -729 -15=-700. As x→infty, -3x^5 dominates, so negative. At x=0: -15. So in x>0, the function 5x² -3x⁵ -15 is always negative (since it starts at -15 and goes to -infty). So only the one real root at x≈-1.208. Therefore, only two critical points: x≈-1.208 (local maximum) and x=0 (critical point but not extremum).\\n\\nNow, let's try to sketch the graph. Starting from the vertical asymptote at x≈-1.38, the function approaches -infty. Then, as x increases from -1.38 to -1.208, the function increases (since the derivative is positive there?) Wait, at x approaching -1.38 from the right, the function goes to -infty. Then, moving towards x≈-1.208, the derivative was positive before -1.208 and negative after, meaning the function is increasing until x≈-1.208, then decreasing after. Wait, but the critical point at x≈-1.208 is a local maximum. So the function increases from -infty at x≈-1.38 up to x≈-1.208, reaching a local maximum, then decreases after that. Then, at x=0, there's a critical point but the function continues decreasing. Then, after x=0, continues decreasing towards -infty as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nWait, but after x=0, does the function decrease monotonically? Let's check the derivative for x>0. Take x=1: g'(1)= (5*1)/(1 +5) -3*1=5/6 -3≈0.833 -3≈-2.167 <0. So derivative is negative, so decreasing. So from x=0 onward, the derivative remains negative, so the function is decreasing. So after the local maximum at x≈-1.208, the function decreases all the way to the right, passing through (0, ln5≈1.609), then crosses the x-axis around x≈1.29, then continues decreasing to -infty.\\n\\nNow, let's check concavity. Using the second derivative:\\n\\ng''(x) = [(-5x^8 +100x³)/(x⁵ +5)^2] -6x.\\n\\nThis is complicated, but maybe we can find inflection points where g''(x)=0. However, solving this equation algebraically is difficult. Alternatively, we can analyze the sign of the second derivative in different intervals.\\n\\nLet me check concavity at some points:\\n\\nAt x=0, g''(0)=0, as we saw. To the left of x=0, say x=-1:\\n\\nCompute g''(-1). Let's compute numerator of first term: -5*(-1)^8 +100*(-1)^3= -5*1 +100*(-1)= -5 -100= -105. Denominator: (-1)^5 +5= -1 +5=4, squared is16. So first term: -105/16≈-6.5625. Then -6x= -6*(-1)=6. So g''(-1)= -6.5625 +6≈-0.5625 <0. So concave down at x=-1.\\n\\nAt x=1: compute g''(1). First term numerator: -5*(1)^8 +100*(1)^3= -5 +100=95. Denominator: (1 +5)^2=36. So first term:95/36≈2.6389. Then -6x= -6*1= -6. So g''(1)=≈2.6389 -6≈-3.361 <0. So concave down at x=1.\\n\\nAt x=2: g''(2). Numerator: -5*(256) +100*(8)= -1280 +800= -480. Denominator: (32 +5)^2=37²=1369. First term: -480/1369≈-0.350. -6x= -12. So total g''(2)≈-0.350 -12≈-12.35 <0. Still concave down.\\n\\nAt x approaching -1.38 from the right: very near the asymptote. Let x be approaching -1.38 from the right. The first term in g''(x) is [(-5x^8 +100x³)/(x⁵ +5)^2]. As x approaches -1.38, x⁵ +5 approaches 0, so denominator approaches 0. Let's approximate x⁵≈-5 (since x⁵ +5 approaches 0). Wait, x≈-5^(1/5). x⁵ +5≈0. So x⁵≈-5. Then numerator: -5x^8 +100x³. Let me substitute x⁵≈-5. So x^8= x^5 *x³≈ (-5)x³. So numerator≈-5*(-5)x³ +100x³=25x³ +100x³=125x³. Denominator≈(x⁵ +5)^2≈0. So first term≈125x³ /0^2. Wait, but x approaches -5^(1/5). x≈-1.38. So x³≈(-1.38)^3≈-2.628. So numerator≈125*(-2.628)≈-328.5. Denominator approaching 0. Therefore, the first term approaches -infinity. The second term, -6x≈-6*(-1.38)=8.28. So total g''(x) approaches -infinity +8.28≈-infinity. So concave down near the asymptote.\\n\\nAt x approaching infinity: the first term [(-5x^8 +100x³)/(x⁵ +5)^2] ≈ (-5x^8)/x^10 = -5/x² →0. The second term -6x approaches -infty. So g''(x) approaches -infty. So concave down as x→infty.\\n\\nSo overall, the function seems to be concave down everywhere in its domain except possibly at some points. Wait, but let's check between x≈-1.208 and x=0. Maybe there's an inflection point?\\n\\nWait, at x=0, g''(0)=0. Let's check just left and right of x=0.\\n\\nAt x=0.1: as computed before, g''(0.1)= [(-5*(0.1)^8 +100*(0.1)^3)/( (0.1)^5 +5 )^2 ] -6*(0.1). Compute numerator: -5*(1e-8) +100*(0.001)= -5e-8 +0.1≈0.09999995. Denominator: (0.00001 +5)^2≈25.0000000001. So first term≈0.09999995 /25.0000000001≈0.004. Then subtract 0.6. So≈0.004 -0.6≈-0.596. So g''(0.1)≈-0.596 <0. Concave down.\\n\\nAt x=-0.1: g''(-0.1)= [(-5*(-0.1)^8 +100*(-0.1)^3)/( (-0.1)^5 +5 )^2 ] -6*(-0.1). Compute numerator: -5*(1e-8) +100*(-0.001)= -5e-8 -0.1≈-0.10000005. Denominator: (-0.00001 +5)^2≈24.99999^2≈624.9995. So first term≈-0.10000005 /624.9995≈-0.00016. Second term: -6*(-0.1)=0.6. So g''(-0.1)≈-0.00016 +0.6≈0.59984 >0. So concave up?\\n\\nWait, that's interesting. So at x=-0.1, the second derivative is positive. But at x=0.1, it's negative. So there's an inflection point at x=0. But wait, at x=0, g''(0)=0. So the concavity changes from concave up to concave down at x=0. Therefore, x=0 is an inflection point.\\n\\nWait, but earlier, I thought the derivative is negative on both sides of x=0, but the concavity changes at x=0. So, even though the function is decreasing throughout, the concavity changes at x=0. Therefore, the graph is concave up to the left of x=0 and concave down to the right of x=0.\\n\\nSo, summarizing:\\n\\n- Vertical asymptote at x≈-1.38.\\n- Function approaches -infty as x approaches -1.38 from the right.\\n- Increases to a local maximum at x≈-1.208.\\n- Then decreases, passing through (0, ln5≈1.609).\\n- Concave up before x=0, concave down after x=0.\\n- Crosses the x-axis around x≈1.29.\\n- Continues decreasing to -infty as x approaches infinity.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the graph starts at the bottom (negative infinity) near x≈-1.38, rises to a peak at x≈-1.208, then decreases, curving concave up until x=0, then concave down beyond, passing through the y-intercept at (0, ~1.609), crossing the x-axis around x≈1.29, and then plunging downward to the right.\\n\\nTo sketch this, one would draw a vertical dashed line at x≈-1.38 as the asymptote. Then, from the right side of this asymptote, the curve comes up sharply, reaches a peak at x≈-1.208, then decreases. The curve is concave up until it hits the inflection point at x=0, then becomes concave down. It crosses the y-axis at around 1.6 and the x-axis at around 1.29, then continues to decrease steeply as x increases.\\n\\nI think that covers the key features needed for the sketch. The main points are the vertical asymptote, local maximum, inflection point at x=0, intercepts, and end behavior.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\ln(x^5 + 5) - x^3 \\\\) has the following key features for graphing:\\n- **Domain**: \\\\( x > -\\\\sqrt[5]{5} \\\\approx -1.38 \\\\), with a vertical asymptote at \\\\( x = -\\\\sqrt[5]{5} \\\\).\\n- **Intercepts**: \\n  - **Y-intercept** at \\\\( (0, \\\\ln 5) \\\\approx (0, 1.609) \\\\).\\n  - **X-intercept** near \\\\( x \\\\approx 1.29 \\\\), found numerically.\\n- **Critical Points**:\\n  - **Local maximum** at \\\\( x \\\\approx -1.208 \\\\).\\n  - A critical point at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\) (not an extremum, with the function decreasing through this point).\\n- **Concavity**:\\n  - **Concave up** for \\\\( x < 0 \\\\).\\n  - **Concave down** for \\\\( x > 0 \\\\), with an inflection point at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\).\\n- **End Behavior**:\\n  - As \\\\( x \\\\to -\\\\sqrt[5]{5}^+ \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\to -\\\\infty \\\\).\\n  - As \\\\( x \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\to -\\\\infty \\\\).\\n\\nThe graph starts near the vertical asymptote \\\\( x \\\\approx -1.38 \\\\), rises to a local maximum at \\\\( x \\\\approx -1.208 \\\\), decreases through the y-intercept at \\\\( (0, \\\\ln 5) \\\\), crosses the x-axis near \\\\( x \\\\approx 1.29 \\\\), and continues decreasing to \\\\( -\\\\infty \\\\) as \\\\( x \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\).
